Questions:

Which predictions, if any, proved incorrect as you increased the number of simulations?:

With a small number of simulations, not even half of all the teams were able to win at least once.
But the more simulations we did, the more the chance of a team to win was closely related to its rating.

Suppose you're charged a fee for each second of compute time your program uses.
After how many simulations would you call the predictions "good enough"?:

It seems like the predictions stabilized after about 10000 simulations.
