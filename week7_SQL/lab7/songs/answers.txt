This listener had a pretty sad mood audio aura as his average valence is only 0.484443.
But on the other hand, his audio aura was energetic and danceable as his average energy was 0.65906 and his average danceability was 0.71646.

This might not be well representativ because those numbers are average across the whole year.
Also some songs might be over-represented because the listener played those songs a lot in a short period of time.
To be more representative would be to estimate those averages and their evolution across time.
